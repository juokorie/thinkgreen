                <p>AgSTAR promotes the use of biogas recovery systems to reduce methane emissions from livestock waste. Biogas recovery also helps achieve other social, environmental, agricultural and economic benefits. AgSTAR assists those who enable, purchase or implement anaerobic digesters by identifying project benefits, risks, options and opportunities. AgSTAR provides information and organizes events to create a supporting environment for anaerobic digester implementation.</p>

                <h2>Landfill Methane Outreach Program</h2>
                <p>LMOP is a voluntary program that works cooperatively with industry stakeholders and waste officials to reduce or avoid methane emissions from landfills. LMOP encourages the recovery and beneficial use of biogas generated from organic municipal solid waste (MSW). Landfill gas (LFG) and other biogas generated from MSW (collectively referred to as biogas) contain methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be captured and used as a renewable fuel for many end uses including electricity generation, industrial heat applications, and vehicle fuel. Capturing and using biogas reduces local air pollution, creates health benefits, generates revenue and jobs in the community and may also offset the use of non-renewable resources. LMOP forms partnerships with communities, landfill owners and operators, utilities, power marketers, states, project developers, Tribes and nonprofit organizations to overcome barriers to project development. LMOP focuses on LFG energy project development at MSW landfills, the largest source of methane emissions from the waste sector.</p>

                <h2>RE-Powering America’s Land </h2>
                <p>EPA’s RE-Powering America’s Land Initiative encourages renewable energy development on current and formerly contaminated lands, landfills, and mine sites when such development is aligned with the community’s vision for the site. The Initiative identifies the renewable energy potential of these sites and provides other useful resources for communities, developers, industry, state and local governments or anyone interested in reusing these sites for renewable energy development. Potentially contaminated land includes sites where contamination is suspected but has not been confirmed and sites where contamination has been identified. Targeted sites include brownfields, Superfund sites, sites subject to corrective action under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), mining sites, and landfills. RE-Powering has facilitated redevelopment efforts to reuse abandoned industrial sites for wind farms and former landfills for solar arrays. These projects generate returns nationwide from Georgia to Massachusetts, New York to California. These projects not only advance cleaner and more cost effective energy technologies and but also reduce the environmental impacts of energy systems.</p>

                <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the Green Power Partnership (GPP) in 2001 to encourage organizations to use green power voluntarily to protect human health and the environment. The goals of the Green Power Partnership are to "advance the American market for green power.
                    , Encourage the development of new U.S.-based renewable electricity sources
                    , Reduce air emissions and pollution
                    , Recognize leadership and impact in green power use
                    , and Support basic market principles and practices that serve all U.S. electricity consumers"
                    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Green Power Partnership is a voluntary program that encourages organizations to buy green power to reduce the environmental impacts of their electricity use. The Partnership currently has more than 1,300 Partner organizations that purchase more than 17 billion kilowatt-hours of green power each year. Partners include Fortune 500 companies, small and medium-sized businesses, local, state, and federal governments, and colleges and universities. For more information visit EPA's Green Power website.

                <h2>CHP Partnership</h2>
                <p>The CHP Partnership seeks to reduce the environmental impacts of electric power generation by promoting the use of CHP.  The Partnership works closely with energy users; the CHP industry; state, local, and tribal governments; clean air officials; and other clean energy stakeholders to facilitate the development of new projects.Typically, nearly two-thirds of the energy used to generate electricity is wasted in the form of heat discharged to the atmosphere. CHP is on-site electricity generation that captures the heat that would otherwise be wasted to provide useful thermal energy such as steam or hot water than can be used for space heating, cooling, domestic hot water and industrial processes. CHP can achieve efficiencies of over 80 percent, compared to 50 percent for conventional technologies (i.e., grid-supplied electricity and an on-site boiler). In the U.S. CHP is used in factories, apartment buildings, and commercial/institutional buildings such as offices, hospitals and universities, as well as in municipal applications such as waste water treatment facilities and swimming pools.  CHP’s principal benefits are reduced electricity cost, reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, and increased electricity-supply reliability.
                    The CHP Partnership provides:
