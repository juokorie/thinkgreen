                    Homeowners can reduce their energy bills by up to 62% with solar panels. This means that renewable energy is a great purchase for cutting costs while also reducing carbon emissions. Despite the relatively high up-front costs, your investment will break even in a short time span of around 8 to 9 years.Using solar power instead of conventional forms of energy reduces the amount of carbon and other pollutants that are emitted into the environment. Reducing the amount of carbon in our atmosphere translates into less pollution and cleaner air and water. According to EPA.gov in the average american household the  annual CO2 emissions are 14,020 pounds per household. Using solar help to cut that number down exponentially.
                    Solar panels are usually made from silicon, or another semiconductor material installed in a metal panel frame with a glass casing. When this material is exposed to photons of sunlight (very small packets of energy) it releases electrons and produces an electric charge.

                <p>
                    Solar panels cost, on average, about $16,000, or between $4,500 to $36,000 depending on the type and model as well as any inverters and the BOS, or balance of the system that includes any equipment that’s required to operate. While solar panels can help save you money on energy costs, it’s important to know the overall startup solar panel costs so you can make a budget.

                <h2>Tax Credit Information</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the passing of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the federal government
                    has incentivized homeowners to switch to solar energy with the solar
                    investment tax credit (ITC), also known as the federal solar tax credit.
                    The rate of this credit has fluctuated over the years but currently allows 
                    you to claim 30% of your total solar system costs as a federal tax credit.
                    This guide covers how to qualify and file for the federal solar tax credit
                    so you can get money back on your solar power system.

                    <h3>Pro:</h3>
                    <p>Solar power offers a sustainable, renewable source of energy. This means you can limit your reliance on fossil fuels and reduce your carbon footprint. Solar energy allows you to get the power you need in a clean manner, and helps to limit your impact on the planet. Solar power also saves money in the long run. While the upfront costs can be high, converting to solar will end up paying for itself over the years by no longer having to pay for electricity. You can even make extra money from it when you transfer the energy you don’t use back into the grid.Speaking of the grid, using solar power allows you to completely remove yourself from it. If you live somewhere that gets adequate sunlight year-round and can store the energy you collect, you can completely cut yourself off from the electric grid and not have to rely on anyone else for your energy needs. Solar power is also beneficial because the systems are low-maintenance and can last for a long time. In fact, most solar panels last for around 25 years, with others lasting even longer than that. Helps the Community - Converting to solar power can also help your community. As mentioned earlier, when you collect more solar energy than you need, you can transfer it back into the grid. This helps to reduce the strain of electricity demands, avoid price hikes, and make electricity cheaper for others in your area.

                <div class="comparison" id = "Con">
                    <h3>Con:</h3>
           
                    <p>Location - One con of solar power is that it is weather dependent, and there are some areas around the globe that don’t get very much sunlight. Therefore, solar power wouldn’t be very beneficial in those locations, and probably wouldn’t make sense to install due to inadequate sunlight. However, there are solar panels that can still absorb sunlight even in cloudy conditions, but they will produce energy at a lower efficiency.</p>
                    <p>Cost - The main con or downside of using solar power is the cost associated with it. It can cost thousands of dollars to install solar panels for your home, and it will take a while before they pay themselves off in terms of electricity savings. It’s even more expensive if you plan to store the energy you collect for when you need it later, usually using battery banks.</p>

                        Solar panels can still provide electricity to your house at night, but they cannot draw power in the nighttime. The more scientific explanation is the photovoltaic effect—when solar cells get activated by the sun—which is what causes the generation of electrical current. While they can’t draw power at night, they still work from stored energy. </p>

                        The maintenance of solar panels is minimal. That being said, it is important to keep an eye on the condition and performance of your home solar panel system. Mostly, you'll need to give your panels a good cleaning. That's because dirt and debris can collect on your panels, especially during storms and long periods without rainfall. Beyond that, you might want to schedule an annual inspection with a solar specialist. They can make sure everything is working properly. Solar panels only need maintenance two to four times a year, but check your solar companies manual for panel specific maintenance care. Fall and spring serve as good times to perform maintenance work because panels can need cleaning following winter where dust and debris can accumulate. Fall is also a good time because of the falling leaves and other droppings.</p>

                        Geothermal heat pumps use the earth's constant temperature to heat and cool buildings. Geothermal heat pumps transfer heat from the ground (or water) into buildings during the winter and reverse the process in the summer. A geothermal heat pump is a clean, renewable technology that helps a home or building stay comfortable in any season. It harnesses the constant temperature below the earth’s surface to provide heating, cooling, and often hot water. Since geothermal is an abundant and renewable resource just beneath our feet, geothermal heat pumps are considered some of the most efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly HVAC and water-heating systems available. And because heat pumps simply move heat and don’t rely on combustion, like a gas furnace or water heater, they can reduce energy costs by up to 50 percent and produce zero direct emissions that contribute to air pollution and climate change.

                            The biggest benefit of GHPs is that they use 70% to 80% less electricity than conventional heating or cooling systems. According to the EPA, geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption -- and corresponding emissions -- up to 44% compared with air-source heat pumps and up to 72% compared with electric resistance heating with standard air-conditioning equipment. GHPs also improve humidity control by maintaining about 50% relative indoor humidity, making GHPs very effective in humid areas. The same equipment is used for both heating and cooling and is much simpler than either a furnace or air conditioner. With fewer moving parts to wear out and no outdoor unit that is susceptible to weather, precipitation, debris, extreme temperatures, and vandalism, geothermal systems are highly reliable and simple to maintain. The underground loop system — a one-time installation — lasts 50-100 years, and the interior heat pump lasts 20-25 years (twice as long as a conventional system). As mentioned above, geothermal systems use no fossil fuels and very little electricity, and they emit no greenhouse gases. Geothermal systems can be installed during construction or retrofitted for existing homes. For proper sizing and Installation, choose a knowledgeable, experienced, quality contractor.

                            Geothermal heat pumps can have significant upfront costs, especially if you need to install or upgrade ductwork on your property. You can expect to pay between $10,000 and $30,000 for a complete GSHP installation before accounting for local or federal tax credits and rebates. Air source heat pumps (ASHPs) are typically lower cost and offer benefits over traditional heating and cooling systems but are not nearly as efficient or long-lasting as GSHP systems. Installing a geothermal heat pump involves installing a ground loop system, which can lead to significant above-ground alterations. Particularly with horizontal loop setups, your installer will need to dig trenches over a wide surface area of your property that can change your property's design and physical appearance. Vertical ground loops have a smaller footprint but still involve bringing heavy machinery onto your property. Open-loop geothermal systems are much less common than closed-loop installations, but if you opt for an open-loop system, be aware that groundwater contamination is possible. Because open-loop systems cycle natural groundwater directly, there's a chance that the water that passes through your heat pump and heat exchanger will contaminate the water source you pull from.

                        Solar water heating systems collect the thermal energy of the sun and use it to heat water in homes and businesses. The systems can be installed in any climate to reduce utility bills and are composed of three main parts: the solar collector, insulated piping, and a hot water storage tank. Solar water heating systems can either rely on electric pumps to circulate water (active) or rely on thermodynamics (passive). Active solar water heating systems are more common in residential and commercial use. There are two types of active solar water heating systems: Direct circulation systems and Indirect circulation systems. In a direct circulation system, Pumps circulate household water through the collectors and into the home. They work well in climates where it rarely freezes. In an Indirect circulation system, Pumps circulate a non-freezing, heat-transfer fluid through the collectors and a heat exchanger. This heats the water that then flows into the home. They are popular in climates prone to freezing temperatures. Passive solar water heating systems are typically less expensive, but they are also less efficient. There are two basic types of passive systems: Integral collector-storage passive systems and Thermosyphon systems. In an Integral collector-storage system, a storage tank is covered with a transparent material to allow the sun to heat the water. Water from the tank then flows into the plumbing system. These work best in areas where temperatures rarely fall below freezing. They also work well in households with significant daytime and evening hot water needs. In a Thermosyphon system, Water is heated in a collector on the roof and then flows through the plumbing system when a hot water faucet is opened. The majority of these systems have a 40-gallon capacity.  Most solar water heaters require a well-insulated storage collector. A solar collector is a device that collects and/or concentrates solar radiation from the Sun. It allows for the heating of water for personal use.[2] These collectors are generally mounted on the roof and must be very sturdy as they are exposed to a variety of different weather conditions.[2] There are three types of solar collectors are used for residential applications: Flat-plate collectors, Integral collector-storage systems, and Evacuated-tube solar collectors. In a Flat-Plate collector, Glazed flat-plate collectors are insulated, weatherproofed boxes that contain a dark absorber plate under one or more glass or plastic (polymer) covers. Unglazed flat-plate collectors -- typically used for solar pool heating -- have a dark absorber plate, made of metal or polymer, without a cover or enclosure. In an Integral collector-storage system, Also known as ICS or batch systems, they feature one or more black tanks or tubes in an insulated, glazed box. Cold water first passes through the solar collector, which preheats the water. The water then continues on to the conventional backup water heater, providing a reliable source of hot water. They should be installed only in mild-freeze climates because the outdoor pipes could freeze in severe, cold weather. In a Evacuated-tube solar collector, They feature parallel rows of transparent glass tubes. Each tube contains a glass outer tube and metal absorber tube attached to a fin. The fin's coating absorbs solar energy but inhibits radiative heat loss. These collectors are used more frequently for U.S. commercial applications.

                    <p>According to the U.S. DOE, a solar water heater costs, on average, around $100 per square foot of collector area. For example, if your system uses a solar collector that measures 4 feet by 10 feet (or 40 square feet), the average price is around $4,000. Depending on the complexity of your system, the price can range from around $50 per square foot to more than $400. The above example is very simplified — the actual costs of a solar water heater can vary depending on the type of system and your home’s hot water needs. Solar collector prices can range from around $1,500 for small basic systems to over $13,000 for high-end units, according to EcoWatch.</p>

                            Just like solar PV systems, installing solar hot water will help you save on energy bills. Whether you currently heat your water with electricity, gas, or some other fuel, solar hot water systems provide some amount of free hot water each day, and those savings add up over time. Depending on the technology you currently use to heat up your property's water, your payback period, or the length of time it takes to recoup your initial investment, for solar hot water will vary.Once you install a solar hot water system, you won't need to worry much about maintenance. It's a good idea to replace the circulated antifreeze fluid and have your system inspected by a contractor every few years as safety precautions, but in general, active maintenance requirements are minimal. What's more, a well-maintained solar hot water installation can last for more than 20 years, all the while producing free hot water with solar energy. Any time you use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat up your water, greenhouse gases get released into the atmosphere. Even technologies powered by electricity cause pollution – if you're powering your home's hot water system with electricity from the grid, that electricity is likely generated from fossil fuels. With a solar hot water system, you can be 100 percent sure you're using a zero-emissions renewable resource for your water heating needs.

                            As with many home improvement projects, a solar hot water installation has significant upfront costs. As a rough estimate, a full hot water system might cost around $9,000 before any rebates and incentives (like the federal ITC) that help offset the upfront costs of a solar hot water installation. One of the most important factors to consider when determining the feasibility of a solar hot water system for your property is your local climate. You don't need sun every day of the year for solar hot water to make sense: systems always include a backup heater (usually gas or electric), so even when you have cloudy or snowy days, you won't run out of hot water. However, you'll save more on your water heating bills if you live in a sunny area because you won't have to use the backup heating source as frequently. As the name suggests, a solar hot water system only provides heated water and can't power your electric appliances. To use solar energy to power the rest of your home, you'll have to install a photovoltaic (PV) solar energy system, which produces usable electricity for your property. Importantly, if you have an electric water heater, it may make more sense to install a solar PV system instead of solar hot water, as you can use renewable solar electricity to run your electric water heating setup.

                            A solar water heater will still deliver hot water on cloudy and wet days. So if you have solar hot water collectors on your rooftop, rest assured, they’re still working to produce hot water even on those wet and cloudy days. However, continuous days of cloudy weather can sometimes reduce the efficiency of your solar water heater. Even on a cloudy or rainy day, there is still a chance that the solar hot water system would work due to the available diffused radiation in the atmosphere. However, there is no guarantee that the output will be sufficiently hot. In order to obtain the desired temperature, you must connect the solar hot water system to an emergency electric geyser/ backup to be able to produce hot water even on rainy and cloudy days

                            By using sunshine to heat or preheat your water, you can cut your water heating bill in half. This means you can save $140 annually or $2,900 over the lifetime of the water heater, if you combine solar with a backup gas storage water heater instead of using the gas water heater alone. If you have an electric tank water heater for back-up, you'll save about $280 or $5,200 over the lifetime of the water heater each year on electricity bills.1 Large families with greater hot water needs can save even more. You can also save money by showering in the evening when the water is hotter.

                            First, the number of people is important. Heat pumps tend to take a little more time to heat water, so for homes with a lot of folks, they might not be the best option. Typically, 3-4 people using hot water from a heat pump would be the most you’d want to do to ensure completely uninterrupted service. You can get larger tanks, but the heating process is still slower in heat pumps than other water heaters. Solar water heaters can provide for many more people, as they have both the limitless power of the sun and an electrical backup, and can accommodate 120-gallon tanks. 

                            Generally, the solar water heater will outperform the geothermal which is typically only used in the summer months. However. if you are making the investment into a geothermal system why not take advantage of free hot water in the summer! It typically only cost another $300 to add the desuperheater to the package. In then end any saving is a good savings especially when it is harvested by a renewable resource!

                            Yes, the greatest danger to a solar water heating system is freezing. Even when the air temperature at night is well above 32°F, idle fluid in the collector can freeze, because it radiates heat up to a cold, dark sky. Freezing can be prevented by using antifreeze instead of water as the heat transfer fluid.

                        The function of a residential wind turbine is the same as that of a larger scale wind turbine; it’s just smaller and only serves one property. A wind power generator for home use turns naturally occurring wind power into electricity, using the aerodynamic force from the rotor blades. Wind turbines work on a simple principle: instead of using electricity to make wind—like a fan—wind turbines use wind to make electricity. The wind turns the propeller-like blades of a turbine around a rotor, which spins a generator, which creates electricity.
                        Wind is a form of solar energy caused by a combination of three concurrent events:
                        The sun unevenly heating the atmosphere
                        Irregularities of the earth's surface
                        The rotation of the earth. 
                        Wind flow patterns and speeds vary greatly across the United States and are modified by bodies of water, vegetation, and differences in terrain. Humans use this wind flow, or motion energy, for many purposes: sailing, flying a kite, and even generating electricity. The terms "wind energy" and "wind power" both describe the process by which the wind is used to generate mechanical power or electricity. This mechanical power can be used for specific tasks (such as grinding grain or pumping water) or a generator can convert this mechanical power into electricity. A wind turbine turns wind energy into electricity using the aerodynamic force from the rotor blades, which work like an airplane wing or helicopter rotor blade. When wind flows across the blade, the air pressure on one side of the blade decreases. The difference in air pressure across the two sides of the blade creates both lift and drag. The force of the lift is stronger than the drag and this causes the rotor to spin. The rotor connects to the generator, either directly (if it’s a direct drive turbine) or through a shaft and a series of gears (a gearbox) that speed up the rotation and allow for a physically smaller generator. This translation of aerodynamic force to the rotation of a generator creates electricity. There are two different types of home wind turbines: Horizontal Axis wind turbines and vertical-axis wind turbines. Horizontal-axis wind turbines are what many people picture when thinking of wind turbines. Most commonly, they have three blades and operate "upwind," with the turbine pivoting at the top of the tower so the blades face into the wind. Vertical-axis wind turbines come in several varieties, including the eggbeater-style Darrieus model, named after its French inventor.These turbines are omnidirectional, meaning they don’t need to be adjusted to point into the wind to operate.

                    <p>small wind turbines cost between $3,000 to $5,000 for every kilowatt of power capacity. However, the cost of installing a small wind turbine can vary depending on the size of the system, the height of the tower, and the equipment you buy. In most cases, the larger and taller the wind turbine is, the more expensive it will be. Most homeowners using a wind turbine as their primary source of electricity install between 5 to 15 kW of wind power capacity, meaning they can expect to pay between $15,000 and $75,000 for their small wind turbine project. These numbers do not include any federal or state incentives. Smaller farm or residential scale turbines cost less overall but are more expensive per kilowatt of energy-producing capacity. Oftentimes there are tax and other incentives that can dramatically reduce the cost of a wind project.</p>

                            Wind power is a clean and renewable energy source. Wind turbines harness energy from the wind using mechanical power to spin a generator and create electricity. Not only is wind an abundant and inexhaustible resource, but it also provides electricity without burning any fuel or polluting the air. Wind energy in the United States helps avoid 336 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually—equivalent to the emissions from 73 million cars. Since wind turbines themselves run strictly on the power of wind generated, there is no need for fuel. Once the turbine is complete and installed, it doesn’t need to be fueled or connected to power to continue working. This also reduces the overall cost to continue to run large-scale wind farms in comparison to other forms renewable energies, which require may require some energy investment.Land-based, utility-scale wind turbines provide one of the lowest-priced energy sources available today. Furthermore, wind energy’s cost competitiveness continues to improve with advances in the science and technology of wind energy.

                        <p>Wind energy suffers from what is called intermittency, which is a disruption caused by the inconsistency of the wind itself. Since wind can blow at various speeds, it’s hard to predict the amount of energy it can collect at a given time. This means suppliers and cities need to have an energy reserve or alternative sources of power in case the winds die down for longer lengths of time.

                            One big disadvantage of wind energy is that no matter how great the technology becomes, a wind turbine will never be able to be more than 59.3% efficient according Betz’s Law.  Betz’s law states that the wind which passes through the blades of a wind turbine can never be captured to more than a 59.3% efficiency because of the physical laws of moving parcels of air.

                            Horizontal turbines are more suited to capture sustained high-quality winds. They’re placed high up on large towers to capture the stronger wind at higher altitudes. Since they have to rotate to face the breeze, horizontal turbines don’t do well in gusty winds with variable wind directions. Vertical turbines, on the other hand, are omnidirectional, so they are more efficient than HAWTs when it comes to gusty weather where the wind blows from all directions. That makes them well-equipped to generate power in urban areas, where buildings and tall structures create variable wind patterns. The blades of a horizontal turbine are always at an optimal angle to the wind. They also have had more resources allocated to perfecting their design.

Wind speeds generally increase with increasing elevation above the earth’s surface.In order to assess the viability of purchasing a turbine, we recommend setting up an anemometer to get site-specific data over a 12-month period (to get your seasonal averages).
